                <h2>Russia's Attempt</h2>
                <p>
                        Russian spaceship Luna-25 failed its mission in trying to land on the 
                        South Pole of the Moon. In the race to be the first, the ship flew erratically and crashed onto the surface.
                        One of the main reasons for the voyage is the frozen water believed to be on that pole.

                <p>
                        On August 23rd, India made the first landing on the Moon's South Pole, racing against Russia. Chandrayaan-3, the unmanned moon lander, would be able to conduct
                        tests on the Pole. This achievement is an important milestone for the country.
